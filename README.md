# Andelabs
This repo was created with the sole purpose of helping devs at the andela bootcamp have easy access to some basic javascript code.
It is not meant to be all sufficient code as the code was written by students like you at the bootcamp too. 
It is only meant to assist you. Donot fork or clone this repo if you have no intention to make it better.

Thanks
